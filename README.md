##PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
~~Please talk with Dylan and I before moving on to Milestone 2.~~

Good job on defining an overall purpose, audience, and goal for your PWP. This sounds like it will be an excellent professional profile/portfolio site. This milestone passes at Tier II. Please be mindful of deadlines in the 
future, as time is very limited for our class projects.
