##PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
~~Please talk with Dylan and I before moving on to Milestone 2.~~

Good job on defining an overall purpose, audience, and goal for your PWP. This sounds like it will be an excellent professional profile/portfolio site. This milestone passes at Tier II. Please be mindful of deadlines in the 
future, as time is very limited for our class projects.

###Suggestions and Edits.
There are a few minor errors in your HTML.
- The closing &lt;/body&gt; tag is incomplete.
- You are missing a closing &lt;/html&gt; tag.

##Milestone 2 Feedback
Nice work on Milestone 2. I see three pages that you plan to create for your site: Portfolio, About Me, and Contact. Will there be a Home or landing page as well?

Your HTML looks good, and all requirements have been met. Your Milestone 2 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

## Milestone 3 Feeback
Your Milestone 3 passes at level II, so you can get started on developing your site.

I'm not very clear on what the areas of the layout are, but this is what I see:

	Laptop/Desktop:
	- top nav bar with logo on md/lg screens only
	- 4 horizontal "tiles" of content (these will stack using bootstrap)
	- footer on md/lg screens only

	Mobile:
	- footer navbar on mobile only
	- 4 horizontal "tiles" stack on mobile

Beware of using text in the footer navigation buttons... this can be problematic on very small screens if there is not enough room for the text. Icons might work better here. Also, an easy fix would be to hide the nav and have a show/hide toggle button for it.

The layout you have chosen may require some more complex Bootstrap to work properly. Start simple, and don't hesitate to simplify the layout if coding it becomes problematic, and that will make your development process easier and faster.

Take a look at these Bootstrap features:

- [Navbar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar)
