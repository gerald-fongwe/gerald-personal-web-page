##PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
~~Please talk with Dylan and I before moving on to Milestone 2.~~

Good job on defining an overall purpose, audience, and goal for your PWP. This sounds like it will be an excellent professional profile/portfolio site. This milestone passes at Tier II. Please be mindful of deadlines in the 
future, as time is very limited for our class projects.

###Suggestions and Edits.
There are a few minor errors in your HTML.
- The closing &lt;/body&gt; tag is incomplete.
- You are missing a closing &lt;/html&gt; tag.

##Milestone 2 Feedback
Nice work on Milestone 2. I see three pages that you plan to create for your site: Portfolio, About Me, and Contact. Will there be a Home or landing page as well?

Your HTML looks good, and all requirements have been met. Your Milestone 2 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).
