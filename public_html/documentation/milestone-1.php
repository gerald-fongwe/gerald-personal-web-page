		<h1>The idea behind my web page</h1>
		<p>My web page is going to be about me, my coming to the US,
			and the choices i have made and how those choices have
			help me to become who i am and the choices i am making
			now that will affect and equip me for the future.
		It will be to let employers know that i am a person of character,
			who can easily adapt to any work environments, always
			willing and ready to learn, willing to give the best of me
		 as a team member or as an individual, reliable and will encourage
		others colleagues as we work together.</p>
		<p>Employers looking for adaptable workers who are ready to
		go the extra mile to work and give their best, not easily
			discouraged by circumstances and differences in the work
			environment. My website will be viewed by Corporate
			employers especially those involved in customer service,
			Oil and Gas companies, because I have experience in those
			areas and possibly institutions such as schools, colleges
			and the government.</p>
