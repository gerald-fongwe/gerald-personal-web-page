	<h1>The idea behind my web page</h1>
	<p>The idea behind my web page will be to help middle age and above people, who are tired of their present jobs or
	are unemployed and are looking forward to either changing career or looking for a new career. This will also help
	people who come to the US after reaching middle age and are looking forward to going back to school for a career and
	do not have the time to go through the regular four years degree programs or post graduate degree programs.The web
	 page will provide available short course programs like the <Stong>CNM STEMULUS</strong> programs and others </p>
